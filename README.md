# AWS Cloud Project

AWS Certifications are a great-way to get started with AWS and be aware of the services AWS offer. 
However doing AWS certifications is one thing, but I always felt i'm short the pratical implemetation of AWS skills i'm learning.
I always wanted to mimck the production-grade setup like how an application from the localhost is lifted and shifted to AWS. So, by taking an app and then deploying it to AWS would make sense to learn the AWS efficiently, because of the fact I will face the real world issues and how I go on to troublshooting them. This project is the accumaltion of all the AWS skills I learnt to deploy an application by simulating the production grade setup.
