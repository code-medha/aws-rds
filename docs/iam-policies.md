Three different IAM policy concepts

| Policy Type               | Attached To            | Purpose                     |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Permission policy**     | User / Role / Resource | What actions are allowed    |
| **Trust policy**          | **IAM Role only**      | Who can assume the role     |
| **Resource-based policy** | AWS Resource           | Who can access the resource |
